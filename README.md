## Basic Concept?

*Could be handy to pop that here?*

## Contribution Things

Just some things that I think might be important to consider/remember:

- **Don't edit the same scene someone else is** (Usually means conflicts. Unity `.scene` files are not very fun to resolve conflicts in)
- Could be handy to share core components (like player movement and stuff) across scenes
- If not possible, maybe use namespaces + different names? (Basically, avoid conflicting class names)
